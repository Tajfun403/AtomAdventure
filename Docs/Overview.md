# Overview
Atom will be a simple, online 2d browser-based space shooter game, taking heavy inspiration from games such as agar.io, slither.io, Space Invaders, or the .io one with tanks.

# Name choice
- The game will be based in space.
- Space Invaders is already well known
- Since we're in space, maybe Atom?
- AtomAdventure
    - AtomInvaders

# Game loop
- The player is a simple, 2d spaceship.
- The spaceship will be able to shoot basic bullets.
    - The bullets can destroy enemies.
    - Enemies are all kamikaze-style asteroids, so that the AI will be simpler
- Besides this, the player can pickup items from the map
    - When an item is approached, it will glow in violet and a prompt for pick up will appear
- Each killed enemy also gains you Prestige
- Picked up items are merely thropies and can be sold for Prestige, or discarded
- No player accounts, but the player will have to be able to rename themselves (assigment requirements).
